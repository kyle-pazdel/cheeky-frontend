## Getting Started

### Introduction

<p>This app is built by a queer person for queer people! Have you ever thought, my birthday party is looking to be fabulous, but it's just missing something? Well, Cheeky is the app to calm your fears. Cheeky is a booking platform designed with Drag Performers in mind. It allows a user to create bookings with Queens at a specified date and timeframe, with easy address input that is geocoded and returned on the map in a user-friendly detailed event page. Cheeky also permits users that have made a booking with a queen to share their thoughts in the form of rated reviews.</p>
<p>Additionally, a user can create a talent management account to list themself and others to be seen by other users and booked. They can set account details like their hourly rates, location, longest at shortest gig length, and upload media to be shared on their accounts' profiles.</p>
